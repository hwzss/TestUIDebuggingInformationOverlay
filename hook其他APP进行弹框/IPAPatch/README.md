2. **Prepare Decrypted IPA File**
  
   The IPA file you use need to be decrypted, you can get decrypted ipa from jailbroken device or download directly from ipa download site, such as http://www.iphonecake.com
  
3. **Replace Placeholder IPA**

   Replace the IPA file located at `IPAPatch/Assets/app.ipa` with yours, this is a placeholder file. The filename should remain `app.ipa` after replacing.

   External frameworks can be placed at `IPAPatch/Assets/Frameworks` folder. Frameworks will linked automatically.
  
   For example `IPAPatch/Assets/Frameworks/RevealServer.framework`

6. **Code Your Patch**

   The entry is at `+[IPAPatchEntry load]`, you can write code start from here. To change apps' behavior, You may need to use some method swizzling library, such as [steipete/Aspects](https://github.com/steipete/Aspects).
